Demo application written during the Fusonic Mega Hackathon 2020. Read more about the problem and the implementation [here](https://www.fusonic.net/developers/2020/03/29/preloading-data-with-angular-router/).


## Development

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

**TL;DR:** `npm start`

### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project for production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
**TL;DR:** `npm run build`

### Production server

The assets generated by the production build can be served with `npm run production`.

**TL;DR:** `npm run build && npm run production`
